# Miko.TextKit
Miko.TextKit is a fork of [RichTextKit](https://github.com/toptensoftware/RichTextKit). Since RichTextKit only supports SkiaSharp 2.X, which does not meet Miko's SkiaSharp version requirements, this forked project has been modified to support SkiaSharp 3.X. Once the upstream RichTextKit subsequently adds support for SkiaSharp 3.X, this fork will be deprecated.
